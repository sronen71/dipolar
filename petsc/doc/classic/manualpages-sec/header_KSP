# Krylov Methods - KSP Manual Pages

<A HREF="PETSC_DIRsrc/ksp/ksp/tutorials/index.html">Examples</A><BR>

The
<A HREF="PETSC_DIRdocs/manualpages/KSP/index.html">scalable linear equations solvers (KSP)</A>
component provides an easy-to-use interface to the combination of
a Krylov subspace iterative method and a preconditioner (in the KSP and
<A HREF="PETSC_DIRdocs/manualpages/PC/index.html">PC</A>
components, respectively) or a sequential direct solver.  KSP users can set various Krylov
subspace options at runtime via the options database (e.g., `-ksp_type cg`).
KSP users can also set KSP options directly in application
by directly calling the KSP routines listed below (e.g.,
<A HREF="PETSC_DIRdocs/manualpages/KSP/KSPSetType.html">KSPSetType()</A>
).
KSP components can be used directly to create and
destroy solvers; this is not needed for users but
is intended for library developers.
